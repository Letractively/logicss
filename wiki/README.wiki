== Introduction ==

The Logic CSS framework is a collection of CSS files and PHP utilities to cut development times for web-standards compliant xHTML layouts.

== What's in the box ==

The main contents of the `logicss/` directory are:

 * *`common.css`* which sets common values for styles since our objective is to have consistent rendering thru common browsers.
 * *`typography/*.css`* these apply typography styles to content.
 * *`font/*.css`* defines or mixes font families for page elements.
 * *`grid/*.css`* gives you the ability to use grids to layout your design.
 * other directories are actually to be considered _EXPERIMENTAL_.

== The utilities in `tools/` ==

For now, only the Grid Builder is available but there's also a semantic-aid tool in the works.
