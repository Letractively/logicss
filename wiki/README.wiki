= Welcome to the Logic CSS framework ! =

*NOTE:* Development snapshots are in the [http://code.google.com/p/logicss/downloads/list Downloads area].

== Introduction ==

The Logic CSS framework is a collection of CSS files and PHP utilities to cut development times for web-standards compliant xHTML layouts.

== Features ==

 * Common cross-browser rendering behavior (not a real reset ala Meyer or like `* {margin:0;padding:0;}` ).
 * Typography with text resizing support (using EMs) and vertical baseline/rhythm.
 * Totally customizable flexible layout grids with generation tool.
   * Elastic with ems (best!)
   * Liquid with percentages
   * Fixed size using pixels

== Planned features ==

 * Easy to use, beautiful web palettes.
 * Design patterns implementations (like breadcumbs).
 * Microformats styling.
 * Many others...
 * If you partecipate in the development you can decide !

== What's in the box ==

The main contents of the `logicss/` directory are:

 * *`common.css`* which sets common values for styles since our objective is to have consistent rendering thru common browsers.
 * *`typography/*.css`* these apply typography styles to content.
 * *`font/*.css`* defines or mixes font families for page elements.
 * *`grid/*.css`* gives you the ability to use grids to layout your design.
 * other directories are actually to be considered _EXPERIMENTAL_.

== The utilities in `tools/` ==

For now, only the Grid Builder is available but there's also a semantic-aid tool in the works.
